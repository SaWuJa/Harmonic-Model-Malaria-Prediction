# Harmonic Model
This repository contains code and methodology for predicting malaria cases using the Harmonic Model. The dataset consists of monthly malaria cases, and the analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and normalization. The main goal was to capture the seasonal patterns in malaria transmission and improve predictions by including past incidence data (lagged variables). Evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and MASE are used to assess model performance. Residual analysis is conducted to ensure the robustness of the model.
